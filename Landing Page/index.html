					<h4>All of the pages on the site are responsive and can be viewed on various devices.</h4>
					<p>This is my second website. I created it to showcase my web and server based skills. Every part of this website has been 
					coded from scratch without prexisting framework. This site will eventually contain a collection of web apps, website templates, and stand alone widgets that will 
					portray the breadth and depth of my abilities. Since the main focus of this site is to showcase my abilities, there will be a lot of 
					filler text throughout. Also, the site may not flow well, as I want to show my ability to tailor and manipulate code to produce various 
					visual effects and structure changes. You can right click on the site and select "View Page Source" at any time to view my scripts.</p>
					<p>This site contains examples of HTML5, CSS3, and PHP.</p>
